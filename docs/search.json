Pulling directly from Kleinschmidt’s (1982, 220) Cemetery Data and Tentative Chronology table, a new seriation was assembled for the Allen Phase sites. For the purpose of the seriation, the Poynor Engraved and Patton Engraved types were each collapsed into a single column, and any row or column included in the Allen Phase section of Kleinschmidt’s (1982) table with a sum of zero was omitted.\n\nknitr::include_graphics('./img/seriation.jpg')\n\n\n\n\nSeriation of Allen Phase burial contexts derived from Kleinschmidt (1982)."

    "text": "Color\nThe 13 elliptical bifaces from 41AN13 were scanned at 1200 dpi using an HP ScanJet G4050. Images were subsequently transferred to a transparent background in Photoshop in preparation for analysis using the colordistance package in R (R Core Development Team, 2023; Weller and Westneat 2019). A histogram binning method was used to group similar colors, and pairwise distances between histograms were computed using earth mover’s distance, yielding three distinct raw material color groups (Rubner and Tomasi 2001). Since one cluster included only a single biface (81), it was dropped from the analysis.\nThe elliptical bifaces were run a second time, then coded as ColorGroup A and ColorGroup B. Images of the bifaces are not included here due to the fact that they originated from Caddo burial contexts. To test whether the bifaces differ in color, the color distance matrix was exported, joined with the qualitative data, then analyzed using a permutational multivariate analysis of variance (perMANOVA), and were found to differ significantly (permutations = 10,000; Rsq = 0.60308; Pr(>F) = 0.0011). The 12 whole/complete elliptical bifaces were subsequently used in an analysis of biface morphology between raw material color groups.\n\nknitr::include_graphics('./img/color.png')\n\n\n\n\nElliptical bifaces from 41AN13 were used to identify raw material color groups. In this graph, dark pink corresponds to bifaces that express the greatest differences in color, while those in dark blue correspond to bifaces with the greatest similarities. By not splitting the clusters further than two groups, raw material color group assignments allow for shifts in raw material tint that articulate with patination."

    "text": "Geometric morphometrics\nPrior to landmarking, elliptical bifaces from 41AN13 were oriented with the most heavily retouched edge at top right. The landmarking protocol uses three landmarks; two horizontal tangents (top/bottom), and the third placed at the furthest extent of the retouched edge bearing the heaviest amount of retouch. Landmarks and semilandmarks were applied in R using the StereoMorph library (R Core Development Team, 2023; Olsen and Westneat 2015). Some bifaces include multiple areas of heavy retouch at the top and bottom of the same lateral edge, while others include one retouched edge at top right and another at bottom left, similar to alternately beveled bifaces.\nTo identify which edge was most heavily retouched, we employed a modified approach to the flaking index initially developed by Miller (2007). The modified approach uses counts of flake scars from each edge in the two most heavily worked areas, paired with a measure of edge length (inclusive of curvature - this is not a linear metric). The number of flake scars was then divided by the length of the worked edge, with the heaviest worked edge identified by the greater value.\n\nGeneralized Procrustes Analysis\nLandmark data were aligned to a global coordinate system (Bookstein et al. 1999; Gunz, Mitteroecker, and Bookstein 2005; Kendall 1981, 1984; Slice 2001), achieved through generalized Procrustes superimposition (Bookstein 1986; Rohlf and Slice 1990; Rohlf 1999) in R using the geomorph and RRPP packages (Adams and Collyer 2015; Collyer and Adams 2018; Adams et al. 2017; Adams and Otarola-Castillo 2013; Baken et al. 2021). Procrustes superimposition translates and rotates the coordinate data to allow for comparisons among objects, while also scaling each biface using unit-centroid size—the square root of the sum of squared distances from each landmark to the specimen’s centroid (Chapman 1990; Dryden and Mardia 1998; Gower 1975; Rohlf and Slice 1990). The geomorph package uses a partial Procrustes superimposition that projects the aligned specimens into tangent space subsequent to alignment in preparation for the use of multivariate methods that assume linear space (Dryden and Mardia 1993; Kent and Mardia 2001; Rohlf 1999; Slice 2001).\n\nknitr::include_graphics('./img/gpa.png')\n\n\n\n\nMean consensus configuration (black) with Procrustes residuals (gray) superimposed by generalized Procrustes analysis (top), and boxplot of centroid size by ColorGroup (bottom).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrincipal Components Analysis\nPrincipal components analysis (Jolliffe 2002) was used to visualize shape variation among the elliptical bifaces, and the scatterplot represents the dispersion of shapes in tangent space (Adams, Rohlf, and Slice 2013; Bookstein 1991; O’Higgins and Jones 1998; Rohlf and Marcus 1993). Shape ranges described by each principal axis are commonly visualized using thin-plate spline warping of a reference image (Klingenberg 2013; Sherratt et al. 2014).\n\nknitr::include_graphics('./img/pca.png')\n\n\n\n\nPCA summarizing shape variation in elliptical bifaces, where gray circles represent ColorGroup A, and orange plus signs represent ColorGroup B.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcrustes ANOVA\nTo assess whether shape and size differed by ColorGroup, Procrustes ANOVAs (Goodall 1991) were run that enlist effect-sizes (zscores) computed as standard deviates of the generated sampling distributions (Collyer, Sekora, and Adams 2015). A residual randomization permutation procedure (RRPP; n = 10,000 permutations) was used for all Procrustes ANOVAs (Adams and Collyer 2015; Collyer and Adams 2018), which has higher statistical power and a greater ability to identify patterns in the data should they be present (Anderson and Ter Braak 2003)."

    "text": "Summary of Findings\nEven if raw material color groups are not found to differ in terms of geochemistry, results clearly demonstrate that two discrete elliptical biface shapes articulate with two distinct raw material color groups, indicating a previously unreported Caddo preference related to local lithic technology. With regard to function, elliptical bifaces may have occupied a ceremonial role in the Serpent/Snake Dance (Howard 1955), in which symbolic implements were heralded to convey elements of the lower world (Gadus 2013). Similar bifaces are depicted in a shell cup recovered from the Craig Mound at Spiro (Phillips and Brown 1978-1984), where both Hero Twins can be seen grasping an elliptical biface. Given the extant differences that occur in elliptical biface shape and color, these implements may have been meant to depict one or more specific species. The amount of retouch along the edges suggests that the bifaces experienced regular use, raising the question of whether the associated colors and shapes may have articulated with specific tools employed to dispatch or prepare offerings for a particular species or group of snakes. Experimental use-wear studies may aid in clarifying whether or not elliptical bifaces were employed for such tasks.\n\nknitr::include_graphics('./img/spiro.png')\n\n\n\n\nDepiction of the Hero Twins engaged in the Serpent Dance, with each grasping an elliptical biface (in red).

Robinson developed the method of seriation by permuting distance matrices. He used a similarity matrix where 200 was the index value for an ordering with itself. A perfect matrix should show consistent decreases from the diagonal horizontally and vertically. The seriation package implements this as a manhattan distance matrix where 0 is the index value for an ordering with itself. A perfect matrix should show consistent increases from the diagonal horizontally and vertically. The AR measure (Anti-Robinson) counts the number of times there is a decrease between adjacent values. The AR_deviation measure weights the index by the difference in values. These are loss measures meaning that low values are better. The Gradient_raw and Gradient_weighted indices are similar, but look at triplets. These are merit measures meaning that higher values are better. There are other options, but these are relatively straightforward.\nThe seriation package has multiple methods for seriating distance matrices. The ARSA (Anti-Robinson seriation by simulated annealing) method attempts to minimize the linear seriation criterion defined by Robinson. Two other methods use branch and bound algorithms (BBURCG and BBWRCG) focus on the gradient measures.\nThe battleship plot shows the BBURCG/BBWRCG orderings, which are consistent. ARSA ordering is consistent with BBURCG/BBWRCG orderings for 2, but is inverted for 3/5 and 1/4.\n\nlibrary(seriation)\n\nRegistered S3 method overwritten by 'seriation':\n  method         from \n  reorder.hclust vegan\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'seriation'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:lattice':\n\n    panel.lines\n\nburial_dist <- dist(burial_pct, method=\"manhattan\")\n# Distance matrix:\nround(burial_dist, 1)\n\n                 AN21-E-Owens-1Bur CE6-Hackney-2Bur CE12-Allen-18Bur\nCE6-Hackney-2Bur              85.7                                  \nCE12-Allen-18Bur             118.2             53.2                 \nAN13-Jowell-Pur              123.1             65.9             73.1\nAN26-Patton-Pur               74.1             57.1             74.4\n                 AN13-Jowell-Pur\nCE6-Hackney-2Bur                \nCE12-Allen-18Bur                \nAN13-Jowell-Pur                 \nAN26-Patton-Pur             71.2\n\nset.seed(42)\nburial_ser1 <- seriate(burial_dist, method=\"ARSA\")\nburial_ser2 <- seriate(burial_dist, method=\"BBURCG\")\nburial_ser3 <- seriate(burial_dist, method=\"BBWRCG\")\nord1 <- get_order(burial_ser1)\nord2 <- get_order(burial_ser2)\nord3 <- get_order(burial_ser3)\n# Suggested orderings\nrbind(ord1, ord2, ord3)\n\n     AN13-Jowell-Pur CE12-Allen-18Bur CE6-Hackney-2Bur AN26-Patton-Pur\nord1               4                3                2               5\nord2               1                5                2               3\nord3               1                5                2               3\n     AN21-E-Owens-1Bur\nord1                 1\nord2                 4\nord3                 4\n\nCrit <- c(\"AR_events\", \"AR_deviations\", \"Gradient_raw\", \"Gradient_weighted\")\nburial_ord1 <- permute(burial_dist, ord1)\nburial_ord2 <- permute(burial_dist, ord2)\nburial_ord3 <- permute(burial_dist, ord3)\ngahagan_dec_ord <- permute(burial_dist, dec_ord)\ngahagan_ca_ord <- permute(burial_dist, ca_ord)\n\n# Comparison between original and ordered:\nResults <- list(Original=burial_dist, Ordered1=burial_ord1, Ordered2=burial_ord2, Ordered3=burial_ord3, CA=gahagan_ca_ord, DEC=gahagan_dec_ord)\nround(sapply(Results, criterion, method=Crit), 1)\n\n                  Original Ordered1 Ordered2 Ordered3     CA   DEC\nAR_events              8.0      3.0      3.0      3.0   10.0   9.0\nAR_deviations        152.4     12.2     12.2     12.2  333.2 267.9\nGradient_raw           4.0     14.0     14.0     14.0    0.0   2.0\nGradient_weighted    135.3    534.1    534.1    534.1 -162.7   6.7\n\nbattleship.plot(burial_pct[ord2, ], \n                col=\"#798E87\", \n                cex.labels = .75)"

Procrustes superimposition translates, scales, and rotates the coordinate data to allow for comparisons among objects (Gower 1975; Rohlf and Slice 1990). The geomorph package uses a partial Procrustes superimposition that projects the aligned specimens into tangent space subsequent to alignment in preparation for the use of multivariate methods that assume linear space (Rohlf 1999; Slice 2001).\n\n# gpa ----\nY.gpa <- gpagen(shapesGM, print.progress = FALSE)\n\n# plot\nplot(Y.gpa)\n\n\n\n# geomorph data frame ----\ngdf <- geomorph.data.frame(shape = Y.gpa$coords, \n                           size = Y.gpa$Csize,\n                           ColorGroup = qdata$ColorGroup)\n\n# add centroid size to qdata\nqdata$csz <- Y.gpa$Csize"
