>This process of comparison, of recognising in one form a definite permutation or _deformation_ of another, apart altogether from a precise and adequate understanding of the original "type" or standard of comparison, lies within the immediate province of mathematics, and finds its solution in the elementary use of a certain method of the mathematician [@RN7522].

# Basis of inquiry 

Archaeologists regularly assume that the physical properties of lithic raw materials are a determining factor in the morphology of stone tools; although, some have argued that this assumption warrants regular testing. Raw material nodule size and mechanical flaking properties are routinely advanced to account for morphological differences that occur between sites and assemblages. The quantitative analysis of raw material color provides a consistent, and replicable means of assigning the bifaces to distinct raw material color groups. To evaluate elliptical biface morphology as a function of raw material color, each elliptical biface from 41AN13 was first assigned to a raw material color group, then analyzed using the tools of geometric morphometrics. Results demonstrate that elliptical bifaces differ significantly in shape, but not size, by raw material color group. This finding supports the interpretation that extralocal producers—and local Caddo users/knappers—conditioned elliptical biface shape not based upon nodule size or mechanical flaking properties, but on the basis of raw material color.

# Analysis overview

Elliptical bifaces comprise an understudied category of Caddo material culture. The elliptical bifaces from 41AN13 (Jowell Farm) were purchased by the Texas Archeological Research Laboratory (TARL) at The University of Texas at Austin on April 13, 1933, and the site is located near Kickapoo Springs Village, south of Frankston, Texas in Anderson County. The bifaces were excavated from a Caddo burial by a local farmer (George H. Adams), and of the 35 bifaces reportedly acquired by TARL when the collection was purchased, 18 could be located, and 13 of those are complete. Due to the dearth of locally-available raw materials of suitable size and quality needed to produce the elliptical bifaces [@RN9364, Figure 2], an assumption also made for Gahagan bifaces from the ancestral Caddo region [@RN11783;@RN21001], the elliptical bifaces are thought to have been imported through trade and/or exchange. This study asks whether raw material color may have been a determining factor impacting elliptical biface morphology.

## Seriation

Temporally, 41AN13 is among the five sites—others include 41AN21, 41AN26, 41CE6, and 41CE12—that Kleinschmidt [-@RN1753, 213-220] analyzed when he built upon the work of Cole [-@RN863] to propose the Allen Phase in northeast Texas. Pulling directly from Kleinschmidt’s [-@RN1753, 220] _Cemetery Data and Tentative Chronology_ table, a new seriation was assembled for the Allen Phase sites. For the purpose of the seriation, the Poynor Engraved and Patton Engraved types were each collapsed into a single column, and any row or column included in the Allen Phase section of Kleinschmidt’s [-@RN1753] table with a sum of zero was omitted.

## Color

The 13 complete elliptical bifaces were scanned at 1200 dpi using an HP ScanJet G4050. Images were subsequently transferred to a transparent background in Photoshop in preparation for analysis using the `colordistance` package in R [@R;@RN11200]. All images were converted from RGB to CIE Lab color space using the D65 (indirect sunlight) reference white as the default for color conversion, and the upper and lower limits of the color range were determined based on colors present in the sample. A histogram binning method was used to group similar colors, and pairwise distances between histograms were computed using earth mover’s distance, yielding three distinct raw material color groups [@RN11201]. Since one cluster included only a single biface (81), it was dropped from the analysis. The remaining bifaces were coded as ColorGroup A and ColorGroup B for the analysis of elliptical biface morphology. Images of the bifaces are not included here due to the fact that they originated from Caddo burial contexts.

In this graph, dark pink corresponds to bifaces that express the greatest differences in color, while those in dark blue correspond to bifaces with the greatest similarities. By not splitting the clusters further than two groups, raw material color group assignments allow for shifts in raw material tint that articulate with patination."}

## Geometric morphometrics

Prior to landmarking, elliptical bifaces from Millsap Cache and Jowell Farm were oriented with the most heavily retouched edge at top right. The landmarking protocol uses three landmarks; two horizontal tangents (top/bottom), and the third placed at the furthest extent of the retouched edge bearing the heaviest amount of retouch. Landmarks and semilandmarks were applied in R using the `StereoMorph` library [@R;@RN8973]. Some bifaces include multiple areas of heavy retouch at the top and bottom of the same lateral edge, while others include one retouched edge at top right and another at bottom left, similar to alternately beveled bifaces.

To identify which edge was most heavily retouched, we employed a modified approach to the flaking index initially developed by Miller [-@RN11459]. The modified approach uses counts of flake scars from each edge in the two most heavily worked areas, paired with a measure of edge length (inclusive of curvature - this is not a linear metric). The number of flake scars was then divided by the length of the worked edge, with the heaviest worked edge identified by the greater value.

### Generalized Procrustes Analysis

Landmark data were aligned to a global coordinate system [@RN8477;@RN7502;@RN11622;@RN11623;@RN11563], achieved through generalized Procrustes superimposition [@RN11138;@RN478;@RN1646] in R using the `geomorph` and `RRPP` packages [@RN1655;@RN11775;@RN11530;@RN1774;@RN9565]. Procrustes superimposition translates and rotates the coordinate data to allow for comparisons among objects, while also scaling each biface using unit-centroid size---the square root of the sum of squared distances from each landmark to the specimen’s centroid [@RN11139;@RN11140;@RN11564;@RN478]. The `geomorph` package uses a partial Procrustes superimposition that projects the aligned specimens into tangent space subsequent to alignment in preparation for the use of multivariate methods that assume linear space [@RN11141;@RN11142;@RN1646;@RN11563].

### Principal Components Analysis

Principal components analysis [@RN1746] was used to visualize shape variation among the elliptical bifaces, and the scatterplot represents the dispersion of shapes in tangent space [@RN8633;@RN5616;@RN11143;@RN7550]. Shape ranges described by each principal axis are commonly visualized using thin-plate spline warping of a reference image [@RN1731;@RN479].

```

### Procrustes ANOVA

To assess whether shape and size differed by `ColorGroup`, Procrustes ANOVAs [@RN1749] were run that enlist effect-sizes (zscores) computed as standard deviates of the generated sampling distributions [@RN1756]. A residual randomization permutation procedure (RRPP; n = 10,000 permutations) was used for all Procrustes ANOVAs [@RN1655;@RN11775], which has higher statistical power and a greater ability to identify patterns in the data should they be present [@RN1719].

## Summary of Findings

Even if raw material color groups are not found to differ in terms of geochemistry, results clearly demonstrate that two discrete elliptical biface shapes articulate with two distinct raw material color groups, indicating a previously unreported Caddo preference related to local lithic technology. With regard to function, elliptical bifaces may have occupied a ceremonial role in the Serpent/Snake Dance [@RN11208], in which symbolic implements were heralded to convey elements of the lower world [@RN5913]. Similar bifaces are depicted in a shell cup recovered from the Craig Mound at Spiro [@RN2447], where both Hero Twins can be seen grasping an elliptical biface. Given the extant differences that occur in elliptical biface shape and color, these implements may have been meant to depict one or more specific species. The amount of retouch along the edges suggests that the bifaces experienced regular use, raising the question of whether the associated colors and shapes may have articulated with specific tools employed to dispatch or prepare offerings for a particular species or group of snakes. Experimental use-wear studies may aid in clarifying whether or not elliptical bifaces were employed for such tasks.

# Data management {-}

Reproducibility---the ability to recompute results---and replicability---the chances other experimenters will achieve a consistent result---are two foundational characteristics of successful scientific research [@RN20918]. The analysis code associated with this project can be accessed through this document, is available in the GitHub repository ([https://github.com/seldenlab/elliptical.bifaces.1](https://github.com/seldenlab/elliptical.bifaces.1)), and digitally curated on the Open Science Framework ([DOI: 10.17605/OSF.IO/2CHFE](https://osf.io/2chfe/)). The reproducible nature of this enterprise provides a means for others to critically assess and evaluate the various analytical components [@RN20915;@RN20916;@RN20917], which is a necessary requirement for the production of reliable knowledge.

Reproducibility projects in [psychology](https://osf.io/ezcuj/) and [cancer biology](https://www.cos.io/rpcb) are impacting current research practices across all domains. Examples of reproducible research are becoming more abundant in archaeology [@RN20804;@RN21009;@RN11783;@RN21001;@RN9364;@RN11264], and the next generation of archaeologists are learning those tools and methods needed to reproduce and/or replicate research results [@RN21007]. Reproducible and replicable research work flows are often employed at the highest levels of humanities-based inquiries to mitigate concern or doubt regarding proper execution, and is of particular import should the results have---explicitly or implicitly---a major impact on scientific progress [@RN21008].
